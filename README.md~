Devise Sip2 Authenticatable
===========================

This gem provides a Sip2 strategy for the the [Devise](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise) authentication framework.

Prerequisites
-------------
 * devise >= 3.0.0
 
Usage
-----

Install Devise and configure according to instructions.

In your `Gemfile`:

    gem "devise_sip2_authenticatable", :git => 'https://github.com/kardeiz/devise_sip2_authenticatable.git'

Somewhere in your `config` folder, define a file `sip2.yml` that contains your Sip2 connection information, e.g.:

    development: &connection
      host: <your Sip2 server host>
      port: <your Sip2 server port>
      ao: <your Sip2 institution ID>
  
    production:
      <<: *connection

In your user model, make sure you specify `:sip2_authenticatable` as a Devise strategy, e.g.:

    devise :sip2_authenticatable, :rememberable, :trackable

That's pretty much it. After validating a user, this gem will call a method `:after_sip2_validation` with a post-validation authentication hash, if this method is defined on your user model. You can use this method to store information about your user. Currently the hash contains the following fields/values: 

    <auth_key>, password, last_name, first_name, email
